# Excel-Challenge
Excel homework week 1


## In column P I used an IF statemnt for the calculation. You cannot divide by 0 so i set it as if L2(Donors)>0 to return E2(pledge)/L2 and if L2 was 0 is returned "No Backers"

## For splitting CAtegory and Sub-Category I used a formula to search for "/" and return the left half of the string -1 to remove to "/"
   I was unable to get the formula to work for the column R so I used text to columns under the data tab
   
## To pull the state and backer count in sheet 6 columns A and B I used a filter on sheet one and copied out the column.  I struggles with Vlookups.
